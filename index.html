<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>I chose to take this class because computer designing is very fascinating to me. The world of how computers work and what it takes to make a website really pushes me to try to learn more about webpage design. I would also like to be able to use this technique of creating websites to my advantage in the future</p>
